# CCO v0.1 - Memory That Works

**Ship Date: Day 1 ✅**
**Lines of Code: ~200**
**Problem Solved: Claude forgets everything between sessions**

## What It Does (Nothing More, Nothing Less)
- Remembers features you've built
- Prevents exact duplicates
- Injects context on session start
- Works right now

## Installation
```bash
# That's it. No dependencies.
npm run cco
```

## Usage

### Test It Works
```bash
npm run start
# Shows what's in memory

npm run memory
# Shows detailed memory

node .claude/cco.js remember "user login"
# Saves a feature

node .claude/cco.js remember "user login"
# ⚠️ Duplicate detected!
```

### With Claude Code
1. Claude reads CLAUDE.md automatically
2. Memory loads on session start
3. Duplicates get warned

## File Structure (Minimal)
```
project/
├── CLAUDE.md           # 50 lines - Claude reads this
├── .claude/
│   ├── cco.js         # 200 lines - Everything here
│   └── memory.json    # Auto-created storage
```

## What's NOT Here (On Purpose)
- ❌ Event system (not needed yet)
- ❌ Plugin architecture (not needed yet)
- ❌ Schema validation (not needed yet)
- ❌ Fuzzy matching (not needed yet)
- ❌ Atomic saves (not needed yet)
- ❌ 15 config files (never needed)

## Real Usage This Week
```bash
Monday: Ship this
Tuesday: Use on real project
Wednesday: Find actual problems
Thursday: List what's missing
Friday: Build v0.2 based on REAL needs
```

## Next Week (v0.2) - Only If Needed
- Atomic saves (if corruption happens)
- Fuzzy matching (if exact match fails)
- Better CLI (if current is painful)

## Architecture Notes (For Future Scale)
```javascript
// Current (v0.1): Monolith
class CCO {
  loadMemory() { }
  saveMemory() { }
}

// Future (v0.4): Same interface, different implementation
interface IMemoryStore {
  load(): Memory
  save(memory: Memory): void
}

// Week 1: FileStore
// Month 2: PostgresStore
// Month 6: DynamoStore
// Same interface throughout
```

## Success Metrics
✅ Solves the core problem
✅ Ships in 1 day
✅ Under 200 lines
✅ Zero dependencies
✅ Actually works
